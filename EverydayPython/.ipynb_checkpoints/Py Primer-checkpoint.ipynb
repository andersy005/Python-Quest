    "**Information Passing**\n",
    "- In the context of a function signature, the identifiers used to describe the expected parameters are known as **formal parameters**, and the objects sent by the caller when invoking the function are the **actual parameters**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Parameter passing in Python follows the semantics of the standard **assignment statement**. When a function is invoked, each identifier that serves as a formal parameter is assigned, in the function’s local scope, to the respective actual parameter that is provided by thecaller of the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "- An advantage to Python’s mechanism for passing information to and from a function is that objects are not copied. This ensures that the invocation of a function is efficient, even in a case where a parameter or return value is a complex object.\n",
